ðŸš€ Project Update: Automating Log Management with Shell Scripting! ðŸš€

I am excited to share my recent work on a comprehensive shell script that automates the process of log management. This script efficiently handles the copying, archiving, transferring, and deleting of log files. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the tasks involved:

Task Overview:

1. Copy Logs:
The script identifies and copies specific log files (SystemOut_*.log and SystemErr_*.log) from the source directory. It ensures only the logs from the last 24 hours are processed to maintain relevance.

2. Archive Logs:
The copied logs are compressed into a gzip archive. This not only saves space but also prepares the files for easy transfer and backup.

3. Transfer Logs:
The archived logs are securely transferred to a remote server. The script performs network connectivity checks using ping and telnet to ensure the target server is reachable before initiating the transfer.

4. Delete Old Logs:
To manage disk space and keep the log directory tidy, the script deletes log files older than 7 days. This automated cleanup is crucial for maintaining system performance and preventing storage issues.

Technical Details:

Language: Bash Shell Scripting
Network Checks: Utilizes ping and telnet for connectivity verification.
Compression: Archives logs using tar and gzip.
File Operations: Copies, moves, and deletes files based on timestamps.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling and log restoration mechanisms to ensure data integrity and reliability.

Benefits:
Efficiency: Automates repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing manual effort.
Reliability: Ensures critical logs are always backed up and transferred without interruption.
Maintenance: Regularly cleans up old logs, optimizing storage usage and maintaining system health.


Here's the expected output of the script with an intentionally incorrect port number to demonstrate error handling:

The log archival, transfer, and deletion process completed successfully, with all specified logs archived and transferred to the target server without any network issues.

No log files were found within the specified criteria for archival and transfer. The process completed successfully with no logs to archive.
